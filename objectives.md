#Aesthetic
- looks like `world at night` map.
- natural texture (not bright or shiney like Blue Marble)
- add a blue caste.
- allows tweet icons and project icons to overlay well: `the icons we add will be like pinpricks of light` -- shedding light on darkness with the projects and community collaboration.

#Zooms
- 0 to 6

#Compilation
- Imagery ala Natural Earth I
- Country boundaries with labels, starting midway
- Major city townspots and labels, at the closest zooms.
