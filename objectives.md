#Initial ask

##Aesthetic
- looks like `world at night` map.
- natural texture (not bright or shiney like Blue Marble)
- add a blue caste.
- allows tweet icons and project icons to overlay well: `the icons we add will be like pinpricks of light` -- shedding light on darkness with the projects and community collaboration.

##Zooms
- 0 to 6

##Compilation
- Imagery ala Natural Earth I
- Country boundaries with labels, starting midway
- Major city townspots and labels, at the closest zooms.

#Draft review

- Proceed with the `bright` map. Use it mostly as is at the world zooms, making it more `blue`. Add a gradient treatment to match provided screenshot (horizontal so there is dark at top, see thru in the middle, and dark on the bottom). This will be obvious here, less obvious zoomed in.
- At the more detailed zooms (Europe in the screenshot), bring in the urban areas from the `solid-color` map. Reduce the satellite image / shaded relief so it's not so prominent. 
- Add in the country boundaries, country labels, townspots and town labels at the detailed zooms.
- For water and dark colors, use the color swatches Grant provided.
- Default zoom is 3.
